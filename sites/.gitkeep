# WordPress Site Directories

This directory contains all WordPress installations.
Each site gets its own subdirectory (e.g., sites/mysite/).

Structure:
sites/
├── mysite/           # WordPress files for mysite.test
├── blog/             # WordPress files for blog.test
└── ...

These directories are mounted to /var/www/ in the PHP-FPM container.
